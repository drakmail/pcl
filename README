===============
PCL is a Python and CGI/WSGI powered League/Tournament script, designed
to be as simple as possible.

This script was written due to lack of good and free League scripts.

2. Dependencies.
================
PCL written with help and power of Python 3, and be sure, that you're
using version 3.2 or any higher (at least, it was tested on Python
3.2 and 3.3).

PCL uses MySQL/MariaDB as database, so you have to install pymysql
(or python3-mysql, or whatever it named in your distribution).

As template engine PCL uses Tenjin template engine. Tenjin 1.11
